Now,  generate a keystore file If this is your first time building PTE, call it `release.keystore` and put it in the root of the repo. make sure you have Python3 installed and run `pip install requirements.pip`. Now, you can build the mod! Make sure you put your new translations in the mod folder, then run `builder.py` with `python builder.py`. then spam enter. When you are done, submit your fork as a pull request. We'll review it, and if it's a quality translation we'll add it! <3
